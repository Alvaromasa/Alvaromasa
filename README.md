###  Hi there, I am Álvaro Masa de Vega 👋


I am a Data Analytics student at Edem, a Master who has knowledge about data processing and its application to business when it comes to helping to improve decision-making and the development of machine learning.

Previously, I studied technological ADE, a degree that includes both business administration and management knowledge as well as computer science, such as Java, C, HTML or Javascript. In the 3rd year of my degree, I did an Erasmus exchange program in Lille, France.
